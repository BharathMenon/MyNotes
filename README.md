# MyNotes

Introducing MyNotes, a basic secure Note sharing application that allows users to create and interact with their notes dynamically. I created this using the flutter SDK and the dart programming language.
Huge Respect for Vandad Nahavandipoor(https://github.com/vandadnp) for his amazing playlist(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfUjHNODRoM&list=PL6yRaaP0WPkVtoeNIGqILtRAgd3h2CNpT) because of which this was possible!
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
