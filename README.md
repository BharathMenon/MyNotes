# MyNotes

Introducing MyNotes, a basic secure Note sharing application that allows users to create and interact with their notes dynamically. I created this using the flutter SDK and the dart programming language.
Huge Respect for Vandad Nahavandipoor(https://github.com/vandadnp) for his amazing playlist(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfUjHNODRoM&list=PL6yRaaP0WPkVtoeNIGqILtRAgd3h2CNpT) because of which this was possible!
